If `iobs < nobs`, but something else changes, this overrides the `iobs == nobs` condition and there'll be a new subset created.

This is because nearly all of the above rules can (and are) applied before, or without regard for, the processing stage.

    "\n",
    "A bonus of doing this inside the database, is that the `set` id can be set to a unique sequence, which is quite common in databases. In fact, it could be a foreign key to the primary key of another table that just keeps track of the individual sets that are processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The alternative approach would be to preselect the data from the database table when creating the dataframe. Doing this for each combination of telescope, camera and instrument would be a first step. One could also try to only retrieve frames which have a stage 3 complete, but in a sequence of e.g. 3xL, where the middle frame is still processing, this would end up with just processing the first and third frame, and missing the second frame (the algorithm does not check for this, since the second frame may genuinely be missing: it could have been due to low quality).  \n",
    "Since the idea is that the processing happens nearly live, a time limit could also be introduced when retrieving files from the database: data older than a few days should be ignored. This means that any data that didn't get processed by that time, will have to processed later by hand (or at least, the processing started manually with a different valid time range).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the dataframes still end up being too large, they could be read in chunks (e.g., of 1000 rows). Here, each last, possibly incomplete, subset should be ignored, as it may be incomplete and part of it resides in the next chunk. The chunks should therefore overlap, with the overlap size the maximum size of a sequence (which may be a lot more than `MAXSEQ`). The reason for that is that we still set the status and stage of a sequence that otherwise doesn't get processed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For processing in chunks or within a date range, the set id still has to be unique across the whole table (or at least, unique within a unique group of telescope, camera and instrument). The easiest way to do this is to grab the maximum set id from the data just read, and make sure all new set ids are larger than that. How quickly this runs beyond the number of available integers remains to be seen, but that is unlikely to be a problem."

    "Of course, the database table is just one step in a pipeline process. In the end, a manager tool will regularly scan the database and perform the actions above for frames that haven't reached the last processing stage. The manager will also fire off the process for a certain stage. This process could be a Python function, a Python class (that has e.g. a `run()` method), a module or even a package (if these contain a `__main__` block or module; cf. the `-m` command line option). It could also be an external program (provided it meets certain requirements, like a proper exit code). Finally, the manager tool would also need to update the database once a process has completed (which may be with an error, in which case the status would become 'aborted').\n",

    "What process needs to be run for what pipeline stage, is stored in a configuration file. This might be a (strict)YAML file or a Python file; the latter would allow very flexible rules. Processes may not just be dependent on the current stage, but also on characteristics like the image type (flatfields versus biases versus science images) or other details in the processing table (for example, binning factor could be added).\n",

This might be done with two tables: a processing table with barely the essential information, and a user defined table that contains all the extra characteristics needed.\n",

    "Further configuration details would be subsetting of sequences: in the above example, a sequence of 12 is subsetted into 3 sets of 4 frames, and a sequence of 6 is subsetted into a set of 4 and a set of 2 frames. For the latter, 2 sets of 3 frames may make more sense, or a single set of 6 frames.  \n",
    "There is also the matching on exposure time: for flatfields, this should actually be ignored (twilight flatfields will have changing exposure times to handle the changing sky brightness). Plus, it compares floating point numbers. Generally, this will work fine, but for some characteristics, a valid range may be used instead. For example, the CCD temperature can vary a bit around -20 C, but if the cooler is off (and the temperature is e.g. 5 C), these frames should be grouped into a different subset. Such options make both the configuration syntax and the algorithm implementation quite a bit harder.\n",

    "The final result is a database driven pipeline: new or updated entries in the database effectively start a pipeline. This is in contrast to where a pipeline is started, grabs all available data from the database (the Extract part in an ETL pipeline), processes the data (Transform) and stores the data somewhere (Load). This means missing out on all the niceties of existing pipeline frameworks (for Python, Airflow and Luigi are the better known ones), including all the DAG parts, but it allows a different workflow. It could be possible to create this kind of pipeline within Airflow or Luigi, but it would require some working around the regular scheme used in these frameworks."
